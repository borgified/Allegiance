slide_text_1 = "The term 'nanning' refers to the process of repairing a ship or station using the Nanite Repair System, which is typically mounted on a scout just as a gattling gun would be.";
slide_text_2 = "You will pilot a Rixian Unity scout in this simulation and be asked to nan in many of the same situations you will encounter in real missions.\n\nOne unique property of the Rixian Unity faction is their ships turn quickly on the horizontal x axis (yaw), but slowly on the vertical y axis (pitch).  Rolling your ship so that you make turns along the horizontal axis will give you an advantage.";
slide_text_3 = "Nans fill many important roles.\n\nThey help keep miners and constructors alive when they come under attack. They are able to bring a station's hull back to full strength after a failed attack by your enemy.  Finally, nans are a key support component during bomb runs. Without support, a bomber is an easy target for defenders.";
slide_text_4 = "'Nanning' is effective because while a ship is being repaired it is difficult for defenders to damage its hull.\n\nThis forces defenders to attack the nans first, extending the life of their target significantly.";
slide_text_5 = "The Nanite Repair System repairs a ship's hull, but not shield.  Firing it consumes energy, so only use it when your target's hull is damaged to avoid wasting energy.\n\nIn this mission, you will learn the basics of nanning and put your new skill to use in realistic situations.  Be aware that unlike other training missions, your custom controls will automatically be loaded if you have set them.\n\nGood luck!";
