Starting with build 1641, here are the steps for changing the data for a build *after* the build has been done:

First, go to the \\research\root\federation\builds\nnnn\database directory, where ‘nnnn’ is the build number for which you wish to modify the data.  You will find a copy of the spreadsheet named *balancefs42.xls* that is the version that was checked into SLM when the build was kicked off as well as all the .dat files and batch files, etc.

*Copy* that folder locally on your own machine.  *Modify* your data in that spreadsheet however you want.  *Pump* the data into Robtest or other suitable database.  *Test* the changes with a client and server running that build.  *Repeat* if necessary.  Once you are satisfied that your changes are acceptable, then you can go on to the next step.

Now here’s the new part for you.  You will want to go to the local database folder in a command prompt window and type:

Ø	dumptables out /S <server> /D <database>

where <server> is the SQL server (like OBLSQL), and <database> is the name of the database (like Robtest) into which you pumped your tested data.  This will take all the data you pumped into SQL and write it out over the top of the .dat files in your local folder.

Finally, create a new database directory, called \\research\root\federation\builds\nnnn\databasev2 (naturally, if you have to do this repeatedly, then next one would be v3, v4, v5, etc.).  Copy the contents of the folder from your local machine into the new folder.

Voila!  You’re finished.

FYI, when we setup that server on a machine somewhere (for ourselves, the zone, someone else, whatever), we have to manually go in and run recreate.bat against their server after the setupserver process is completed, because setupserver isn’t smart enough to be aware of your newly updated folder of data.

Any questions, let me know,
